Single Mailbox Server
=====================

This is a very simple email server(SMTP/POP3) that accepts all incoming mails and drops them 
in a single mailbox. I use this server for testing webapplications that send out mails. 

Dependencies
------------

* Python (2.6 and 2.7, 3.1 failed the 5 minute test), assuming python.exe is in your PATH variable
* setuptools (0.6c11)
* Twisted Framework (10.1.0) 

Installation
------------

Make sure you have the dependencies above installed. Then simply run:

python setup.py install

Running The Server
------------------ 

Windows
-------
On windows I noticed you need to run twistd.py with the python command in front of it. Making use of file associations
does not seem to work. 

%PYTHONHOME% is the path you have installed python

python %PYTHONHOME%\Scripts\Twistd.py singlemailboxserver

Linux
-----

Not tested yet, but i guess you can simply run

\path\to\twistd.py singlemailboxserver

On first startup and no options specified it will as for a password that will be used for authenticating when using
POP3. The username is your sytem loginname. You can override this with --pop3username and --pop3password. 

By default the server listens on port 2500 for smtp and 1100 for POP3. You can also override these with command line options. 
To get a overview of all the options append --help to the commands above.
